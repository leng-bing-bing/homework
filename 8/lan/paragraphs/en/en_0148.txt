Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification",[372] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation.[373] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.[374]
