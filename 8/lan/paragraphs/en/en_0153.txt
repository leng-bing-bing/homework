Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[386] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[387] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
